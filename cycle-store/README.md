## Introduction
Welcome to our cutting-edge online e-commerce platform catered specifically to cycling enthusiasts, a groundbreaking initiative by Masai School. This project, born out of our construct week endeavor, is tailored to deliver a seamless shopping experience for bike enthusiasts, allowing them to explore and purchase a diverse range of plants from the comfort of their homes. Boasting a user-friendly interface and secure payment methods, our platform prioritizes a smooth and safe shopping journey.

In the realm of technology, we have harnessed the power of React, CSS, and JavaScript for our front-end development, ensuring a visually appealing and dynamic user interface. Additionally, the implementation of JSON Server continues to provide a robust fake REST API, while Firebase not only fortifies user authentication but also facilitates real-time database functionality. 

To guarantee secure and hassle-free transactions, we've integrated Razorpay for our payment processing needs. Together, these technologies form the backbone of our cycling-centric e-commerce website, elevating the shopping experience for plant enthusiasts on two wheels.
